		"p7058969" : "OPTIONAL: The next major landmark along the track is the Top of the World Lookout, a large rocky outcrop of tescelated sandstone.",
		"p7059037" : "OPTIONAL: It is very easy to miss where the track continues on the other side. Skirt the southern edge of the hill to find it.",
		"p7059045" : "OPTIONAL: A second large sandstone cairn will confirm your progress along the right track.",
		"p7059054" : "OPTIONAL: The ridge will become narrower, offering many filtered views and lookouts along the way.",
		"p7059189" : "OPTIONAL: After a final large hill the track ends on a wide rocky platform with an impressive view across Broken Bay.",
		"p7059205" : "OPTIONAL: Retrace your path all the way back along the ridge to the entrance behind the sign.",

		"p7059224" : "The trail will descend once more into a deep gully and up the other side.",
		"p7059245" : "Eventually the trail joins with a fire trail at the very top of the ridge. Follow the Great North Walk to Brooklyn",
		"p7059268" : "Watch for several short side trails to powerlines that serve as impromptu lookouts across Kuring-gai Chase.",
		"p7059278_p7059287" : "Just before the fire trail turns sharply to the right right down to Brooklyn Dam, there is a hidden lookout with a spectacular view across the Hawkesbury.",
